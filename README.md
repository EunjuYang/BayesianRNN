This repository was created by the group DeepTrading for the Deep Learning course project Fall 2017.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains the source code for the groups attempt at reproducing the results found in the paper "Bayesian Recurrent Neural Networks" by Fortunato et al. (see link below)

* For a notebook running the Bayesian RNN on the PTB dataset, see folder "BRNN"

* For a notebook running the Bayesian RNN on simulated data, see folder "XXXX"
